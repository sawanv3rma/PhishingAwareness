# What is Phishing? 
Phishing is a form of online fraud in which hackers attempt to get your private information such as passwords, credit cards, or bank account data. This is usually done by sending false emails or messages that appear to be from trusted sources like banks or well-known websites. They aim to convince you so that they can manage to have your information and use it as a fraudster. Always ensure that you are certain about whom you are dealing with before you provide any information.
